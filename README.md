# Top Choice 

**College Placement App** based on user data to match students with schools  

#### Name of App: CollegeBored 

***

### **General Description:**

- User can create an account and input data about themselves (GPA, SAT scores, major, location, stay in or out of state) to see the likelihood of getting in
- Users can add schools to their profiles and keep track of schools they've already applied to 

   - **Category:** Education
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is necessary for students to easilly input datat and log in and out of their account.  
   - **Story:** Creates a bridge between higher education and students. 
   - **Market:** Any and all highschool students applying to college. 
   - **Habit:** First generation students can get discouraged and not apply to schools because of the lack of help and information they recieve in highschool. This app. would hopefully help students with the application process and even infrom users of what rescources are available for them! 
   - **Scope:** Very first verison would allow for users to only do the follwoing in the description and later on students will be able to interact and help eachohter out while applying to schools!
