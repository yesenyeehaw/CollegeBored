# Top Choice 

**College Placement App** based on user data to match students with schools  

#### Name of App: CollegeBored 

***

### **General Description:**

   - **Category:** Education
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is necessary for students to easilly input data and log in and out of their account.  
   - **Story:** Creates a bridge between higher education and students who get overwhelmed with university spam emails 
   - **Market:** Any and all highschool students applying to college. 
   - **Habit:** First generation students can get discouraged and not apply to schools because of the lack of help and information they recieve in highschool. This app. would hopefully help students with the application process and even infrom users of what rescources are available for them!
